\section{Evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
\item measurement setup: simulation parameters, repetitions, \dots
\item results: use plots to show the outcome of your work
\item evaluation / discussion: what do the results tell you? What can you infer from them?
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
    \item With a limited number of epochs and repetitions the algorithm doesn't have enough time to approach its theoretical values
    \item C seems to be related to the learning rate
\end{itemize}
