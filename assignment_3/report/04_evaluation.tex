\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

All the results presented in this sections are obtained with a test set containing the examples from $3001$ to $5000$.

\end{figure}

\cref{fig:training_error} shows the train and test error for the network trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent on the first $1000$ examples.
Both the train error and test error drop very quickly during approximately the first $1000$ iterations, then remain almost constant for the rest of the training.
The test error is slightly bigger than the train error:
at the end of the training, the train error is around $0.10$ and the test error around $0.12$.
Since the test error never increases, the model does not seem to overfit the training data.
