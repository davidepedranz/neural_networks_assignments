\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The Rosenblatt Perceptron \cite{rosenblatt1958perceptron} is a device designed to solve a binary classification problem, i.e. the problem of choosing the correct class for given examples, represented as feature vectors.
The perceptron needs to be trained on some training examples in order to determine the best hyperplane to separate them:
hopefully, the learned hyperplane will be able to correctly classify also new points.

In this work, we implement and train a Rosenblatt Perceptron and run some computer simulations to verify its theoretical properties.
In particular, we try to estimate the capacity of the separation hyperplane learned by the perceptron.
