\section{Individual Workload}
The workload of this assignment was divided as follows.

Samuel Giacomelli:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generation of the datasets with noise.
    \item Basic implementation of the Minover algorithm.
    \item Experiments on datasets with different degrees of noise, both for the Minover and Rosenblatt training algorithms.
\end{itemize}

Davide Pedranz:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generation of the datasets without noise.
    \item Stopping criteria and optimization for the Minover training algorithm.
    \item Experiments for the Minover algorithm and comparison with the Rosenblatt one in absence of noise in the data.
\end{itemize}

We worked together on the report.
