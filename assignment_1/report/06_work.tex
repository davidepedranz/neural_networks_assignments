\section{Individual Workload}
The workload of this assignment was divided as follows.

Davide Pedranz:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generation of the datasets.
    \item Implementation of the basic Rosenblatt algorithm.
    \item Experiments for different number of iterations and different values of $N$.
\end{itemize}

Samuel Giacomelli:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extension of Rosenblatt perceptron training algorithm for different values of $c$ and inhomogeneous hyperplanes.
    \item Experiments for different values of $c$ and inhomogeneous hyperplanes.
\end{itemize}

We worked together on the report:
each of us focused more about the part that he implemented, but then we improved and refined the whole report together.
