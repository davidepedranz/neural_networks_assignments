\begin{itemize}
\item general motivation for your work, context and goals.
\item problem: what is the problem you are trying to address, solve, or reason on?

The introduction or first section can also have a different title if you think another one represents better the content. 

Don't write obvious/silly things like ``This is the report of Assignment No.\ 1,'' or cut \& paste here parts of the assignment.
