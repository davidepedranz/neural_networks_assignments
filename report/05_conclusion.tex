\section{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item summarize again what your work did, but now emphasize more the results
\item write conclusions that can be drawn from the results found and the discussion presented in the work
\end{itemize}

Again for very short documents the conclusions can be embedded with the last section, but this depends on the structure you give to your document.
