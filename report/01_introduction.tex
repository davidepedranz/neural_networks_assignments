\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The Rosenblatt Perceptron \cite{rosenblatt1958perceptron} is the first mathematical model of a biological neuron which is designed to solve a binary classfication problem, i.e. the problem of choosing the correct class for given examples, represented as feature vectors.
The perceptron needs to be trained on some training dataset in order to determin the best hyperplane to separate them:
hopefully, the learned hyperplane will be able to correctly classify also new examples.

In this work we implement and train a Rosenblatt Perceptron and run some computer sinulations to verify its theoretical properties.
In particular, we try to estimate the capacity of the separation hyperplane learned by the perceptron.
