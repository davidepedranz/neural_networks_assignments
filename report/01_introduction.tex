\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In this work we will present an implementation of a Rosenblatt Perceptron \cite{rosenblatt1958perceptron}
and how we made use of it in order to obtain suitable data that let us observe how the theory about the capacity of the
hyperplane can be explained through a computer experiment. This experiment can also be interpreted as a study about how many
data can be stored in the Perceptron, even though this is not the main aim of this mathematical construct.
In fact the Rosenblatt Perceptron is the first mathematical model of a biological neuron which is designed to
solve the problem of classifying an input by finding a linear separation in the context of a set containing P n-dimensional input vectors
and in order to be able to determine wether an element belongs to a class or not it needs to be trained on some labeled data
(i.e. it needs to go through a supervised training session).

\item problem: what is the problem you are trying to address, solve, or reason on?
\item strategy: the way you will address the problem

The introduction or first section can also have a different title if you think another one represents better the content. 

Don't write obvious/silly things like ``This is the report of Assignment No.\ 1,'' or cut \& paste here parts of the assignment.
